Robotic vehicles, such as autonomous cars, drones, and rovers, use onboard computers  and sensors to navigate and perform tasks in various environments. Implement a Verilog module to control the movement and navigation of a robotic  vehicle, including obstacle avoidance and waypoint navigation. 20.
# Verilog Design Simulation with Xilinx Vivado

This repository contains Verilog designs for a robotic vehicle controller module along with a test bench for simulation. These designs can be compiled and simulated using Xilinx Vivado.

## Prerequisites

- Xilinx Vivado installed on your system ([Download here](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html))

## Simulation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:


2. **Launch Vivado**: Open Xilinx Vivado and create a new project.

3. **Add Verilog Files**: Add the Verilog files (`RoboticVehicleController.v` and `RoboticVehicleController_tb.v`) to the project.

4. **Compile Design**: Compile the design by clicking on the "Run Simulation" button in Vivado.

5. **Run Simulation**: After compilation, run the simulation.

6. **View Waveforms**: After the simulation completes, you can view waveforms using the Vivado waveform viewer. Load the `dumpvars.vcd` file generated during simulation to visualize waveforms.

## Additional Notes

- You can modify the test bench (`RoboticVehicleController_tb.v`) to include more test cases or customize the simulation setup as needed.
- Ensure that your simulation tool is properly configured to simulate Verilog designs.
- For any issues or questions, feel free to open an issue in this repository.
